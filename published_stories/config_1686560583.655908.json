    "description": "The following story data explores the life and works of Johann Sebastian Bach with particular attention to their resonance in contemporary European culture and identity. We indeed believe that, apart from being just cultural products, cultural works (of whatever kind and of whatever genre) contributed to creating an idea of belonging and to shaping a common shared identity, a European one in our case. In music among the ones who mostly influenced the creation of a European cultural heritage was Johann Sebastian Bach. \r\nThis story will be theoretically divided into two major parts: in the former we will present some bibliographical data on the composer in order to have a clear presentation on who he was, where he was born and what works he worked on; the latter, on the other hand, will deal more with the contemporary resonance that his works had (and still have under major different forms) in our culture. We will indeed have a look at all those cultural products (concerts, books, films) which may echo Johann Sebastian Bach. \r\n",

This story has demonstrated how, despite the fact he was not a very cosmopolitan author because he did not travel much abroad in his life, his music still reaches contemporary audiences and had incredible resonance in both the 20th and 21st centuries. We can therefore affirm that this is indicative of his fortune but at the same it shows how he is linked to a European common taste and, consequently, also a European sense of belonging. </span></p>",
