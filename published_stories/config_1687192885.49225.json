    "description": "The following data story explores the life and career of one of the most influential and prolific composers of the classical period - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. \r\nThroughout his 30-year-long career he created a huge number of composition in diverse genres, largely contributing to the enrichment of the western musical heritage. Along with other great composers of the golden era of music, such as Bach and Beethoven, Mozart left an indelible imprint on pages of the world music history, opening the door for several other brilliant composers that had yet to come. \r\nIn the following data story we will touch upon some biographic data, putting an emphasis on the work activity of Mozart. Finally, we will investigate how Mozart is represented in contemporary culture.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
