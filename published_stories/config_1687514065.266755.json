    "description": "The aim of our story is to present some information about the piano and to look more closely at the story of one of the world's best-known pianists, Ludwig van Beethoven.\r\n\r\nThe piano is one of the most popular instruments and the most harmonically complete one but, at the same time, it is also the most challenging to master.\r\nThe piano was invented by the Italian Bartolomeo Cristofori around 1700. However, before his invention, the piano had precursors such as the clavichord, harpsichord and dulcimer. As a result of this complex evolution, the piano can be classified as a string, percussion and keyboard instrument.",
