    "description": "Indie rock is a genre of alternative rock music that emerged in the 1980s. Its name is derived from \"independent\" as it refers to the independent labels that produced this style of music. This genre is characterized by its non-conformist and do-it-yourself attitude, challenging traditional commercial standards.\r\nIndie rock has been associated with a wide range of subgenres, from jangly and upbeat pop-infused sounds to more experimental and introspective styles. Artists like Blur, Sonic Youth and Tame Impala have become iconic figures within the indie rock scene with their unique and innovative approaches.\r\nFirstly influenced by UK Rock, Punk Rock, Funk and House, this particular genre continues to grow, embracing new influences and pushing boundaries, while still staying true to its independent roots.",
