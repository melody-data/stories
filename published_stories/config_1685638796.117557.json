    "description": "As reported by Encyclopedia Britannica, \"Rock, also called rock and roll [...] is a form of popular music that emerged in the 1950s. It is certainly arguable that by the end of the 20th century rock was the world\u2019s dominant form of popular music\". It is precisely its popularity that makes this genre so worthy of further study. Examining the evolution of rock music across different eras and geographical boundaries, this investigation delves into the genre's transformation over time while shedding light on the involvment of women within this musical landscape.",
