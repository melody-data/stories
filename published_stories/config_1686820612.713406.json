At a very early age he started receiving piano and violin lessons until he became a talented composer, pianist and conductor. During his life he suffered a series of illnesses, including the onset of deafness at 28 which worsened throughout his life until he became completely deaf. Despite this debilitating health condition, he composed 722 works, of which 9 symphonies, 35 piano sonatas and 16 string quartets. He died in Vienna on the 26th of March 1827 and his last words are believed to be \"I will be able to hear in heaven!\". He is one of the greatest classical composers in Western history and his myth still has an influence on today's cultural landscape. </strong></p>",
