    "description": "The following data story explores the life and works of Johann Sebastian Bach with particular attention to his resonance in contemporary European culture and identity. We indeed believe that, apart from being just cultural products, cultural works (of whatever kind and of whatever genre) contribute to creating an idea of belonging and to shaping a common shared identity, a European one in our case. In the music field, Johann Sebastian Bach was one of those who mostly influenced the creation of a European cultural heritage.  \r\nThis story will be divided into two major parts: in the former we will present some bibliographical data on the composer in order to have a clear presentation on who he was, where he was born, what works he worked on and who he was influenced by; the latter, on the other hand, will deal more with the contemporary resonance that his works had - and still have - in our culture. We will indeed have a look at all those cultural products (concerts, books, films) which still echo Johann Sebastian Bach in contemporary culture. \r\n\r\n",
