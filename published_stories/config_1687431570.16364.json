    "description": "Our story aims at providing an overview of the amount of girl bands that have populated the music scene since the very beginning of the last century. Girl bands, especially the ones who have their origins in the United States of America, are many and diverse. This is the reason why, after delineating very briefly the amount of girl bands, the number of members they are (and were) composed of, we decided to focus on a particular girl band whose career is marked by an impressive amount of records and hits. Scroll down to discover who we are talking about.  ",
